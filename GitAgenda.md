##  Git Course Agenda, including some explanations

### Section 0:  Introduction

This section covers the "thinking of git".  You will learn how it all came about, and where it came from. We cover how git is meant to be used, and what differs from other version control systems.  Using Git is also a change of culture, and we discuss this, and will push you to see if something needs to be changed in your company based on this.  

We will walk through the internals of git, and how it is built up.  Then we will show the basic elements of a git system, and how these elements fit together.  

We will then move on to remote storage options.  The course will later go into details on some of the possible options you have, but we have a special focus on GitHub and Azure DevOps. 

The last one up on the introduction is the client tools you can use.  In this section we will go through the different options you have.  The participants will ensure that they have the necessary tools installed, including some special tools for the course (and also very useful afterwards).  If the participants have installed all tools upfront (they will get a list), we will just ensure they are all working as they should. 

Expected time is 1 hour. 

### What are the Levels

The levels define both the maturity you have or want.  If you have very basic needs, you don't need to go to any of the higher levels.  Regardless of where you're going, you can always start working on lower levels. 

We have a [very good definition fo the levels available](https://terjesandstrom.github.io/GitScenarios), these also have some posts that describe what you do on each level. You can read through these to establish of you feel you master this level, and then, if you are in process of having an in-company training, decide what levels you can go easy on, and which you need a more deep training.

These levels are from the developers perspective.  From a DevOps perspective you may have have further needs, that we will address in seperate sections.

If you are a company, you most probably need to be be on Level 4.  You will also need to determine how your company will handle a git system.  The course has a seperate section on maintaing a git system in a company. 

### Section 1: Level 1 - the basics

This section concentrates on the basic git operations.  There are not many of them, and with this knowledge you cando useful work with a git repository connected to a remote storage.  

You will learn how to create a git repository, and how to connect it to a remote. You will learn how to do all operations to both add to it, edit information and retrieve information. 

You might have noticed that this information is actually hosted in a git repository.  With the knowledge from this section, you can do the same!  And the objective of this section is to actually do that, and place your notes from the course in your own similar git repository!  

Option 1: If the partipants have never used git before, we will spend some extra time to work through this more slowly.

Option 2: If the participants comes from TFS VC we will work through some of the differences in the operations between these two systems. 

This section is relatively easy, and we don't spend too much time here.  Expected time is from 30 min to 1 hour.   

### Section 2:  Level 2 - Branching and merging

This section is meant to raise your level to where you can safely work with other people on the same repository.  To do that you need to understand and handle branching.  Branching in git is very different from other systems, and is essential to have a good git experience.  We focus on understanding what branches are, and how they actually work, and also why they are so extremely low-cost in git. 

We also cover the theory of branching, and what kind of branching policies you should promote in your work, with your team and in your company.

You will learn how to branch, and the differences between local and remote branches.  This will be connected with what you learned in Section 1, about how branches works with repository syncronization with the remote.

Merging is a fundamental piece of branching, and as git have different types of mergings we will work through these both in theory and in practice. We will show how you 

You will also learn how branches can easily be visualized in the recommended tools, and how you should visualize it yourself!  It is different!
